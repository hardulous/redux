// useSelector() => it is a hook which accept a function as argument that takes the current state as an argument and returns whatever data you want from it. Itâ€™s very similiar to mapStateToProps() and it allows you to store the return values inside a variable within the scope of you functional components instead of passing down as props.

// useDispatch() => it is a hook which is assigned it to a variable and by this assigned variable become a dispatch function . And with this, we are able to dispatch any action to the store by simply adding an action object as an argument to the new variable 

// here all this hook can work without doing any connect to component

export default CakeContainer
